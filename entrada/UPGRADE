A new column (server_location) has been added in this version, this column is used to store the anycast server location.
Any input directory using the format <servername>_<location> will be parsed into a server and location component.
The server component value will be used for the Parquet "server" partition, the location component value will be stored in the "server_location" column.

This allows for partition pruning at the logical server level while still being able to determine the anycast location for every packet. 

If you have an existing ENTRADA installation, you must upgrade the data model with following SQL lines to add the new column to all the tables.

ALTER TABLE dns.staging ADD COLUMNS (server_location STRING);
ALTER TABLE dns.queries ADD COLUMNS (server_location STRING);
ALTER TABLE icmp.staging ADD COLUMNS (server_location STRING);
ALTER TABLE icmp.packets ADD COLUMNS (server_location STRING);
